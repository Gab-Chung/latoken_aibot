    "https://coda.io/@latoken/latoken-talent/cut-cancer-138": "Cut Cancer  Cut Cancer Parasites are the main killers, not wars. Cut cancer fast, before it spreads through organism. Deadly cultural cancer is when freeriding is Nash stable. The startups are a better solution for the cultural cancer problem, the single reason for them to exist. Valentin Preobrazhenskiy 1. Agent is a deadly cultural cancer - cut it before all organism is infected. Cancer is a cell cheating on an organism when other cells fail to detect and stop it. Wars are not the main people's killer, parasites are. The same about organisations - they shade away due to the infectious cancer culture of agents free-riders. Agents use a lack of transparency to cheat on Principals. Agent try to infect teammates around to lower standards and cover fake work of each other. 2. Cancer Agents use asymmetry of information to freeride Principals. An agent knows details of execution unknown to the principal and this assymetry of information may be used to freeride them. For example: Newly hired HR may blameshift lack of hires to negative attitude of candidates to crypto or to the company. The real reason could be zero attempts to contact candidates or poor quality of communication. If principals do not have capacity to check the number of contact attempts or check messages and calls records, than why not to freeride them? So, again, teammates who work closely with him and know his actual workload have two options: ask him to leave the company or enjoy him as a bar lowerer so their weak performance now look relatively ok and they may cooperate to reinforce the excuses to lower the bar of a Nash stable strategy further. This decision is a differentiator between an Agent and a Principal. Make the right choice, once the wrong one is done, it starts to self-enforce and shape the future for yourself and for humankind. Dr. Ringelmann found out that with a rope pulling team size growth to 8 average effort declines 50%. An exception is only when team consists of professional sportsmen (as free-riders are wiped out fast in sports). 3. Challenge freeriding to make a hardworking Nash stable strategy That is how you ensure no one can benefit with an alternative strategy, thus champion strategy is Nash stable. For example: A teammate uses the freeriding strategy in order to save some time and doesn't make the task “grandma clear” in the SCRUM format “Who needs What for Why”. Saved time allows that teammate to do more tasks than other members of the team, so he may have a career advantage over teammates. Also teammates have less clarity about what he is doing so he may fake his work and do a side business to resell what his teammates produced. If teammates ask him to make an effort to write an appropriate story and give him less score on 360, his benefit on time saving may be below loss in social currency. Thus, his strategy to save time on writing a proper story will have negative profit. Either he will go bankrupt or change her strategy to write a story in scrum format. Small, yet powerful with the compound effect. High Performance Culture  = Agents can not collude against Principals to hide freeriding as: 1. performance is transparent with OKRs, 360 and 2. most of the team are Principals who report freeriding as 3. most of the teammates are motivated by stocks and 4. their goal of life is to change the world with a product Now you know the underlying theory for our layer 1 cultural protocol: I commit to: Put clients first, ego last <= (4. their goal of life is to change the world with a product, 3. most of the teammates motivated by stocks ) Demand exceptional performance from myself and teammates like olympic sportsmen principal (2. most of the team are Principals who report freeriding) Give candid feedback and eliminate talking behind the back (2. most of team are Principals who report freeriding) Use any feedback to grow and never give up, never quit (imminent threat to existence drives evolution) Do the above to have the right answer: Did you detect cancer cells before too late for the organisation organism?

The war is between the past and the future. Once a greater culture is born, it erases cultures of the past. Past cultures strive to survive and thus the war is imminent and intence as cultu3ricide erases way more information than genocide. We do not smell this war with rooten flash on the streets. The war is now on the markets. Cultures compete for clients via products and prices instead of guns. Thus the war is now global and ligtning fast. Evolve culture lightning fast or die. That is evolution. (To avoid confusion, this text is written in 2020. Update from the CEO “I donate to the war refugees. Any violation of human rights is a threat to the free markets and humankind. Humans should compete via fair market competition to evolve, otherwise the technology will destroy us.”) Culture is not something what we have in our hearts. It is not a set of our beliefs. Culture is a set of actions. Who you are is what you do. Culture is how and which decisions are made, especially if no one sees. We have beliefs and Principles and we will do everything to make them working. We leverage shocking rules to make it clear. For example, if one is not following the Rule to be the client of the product her is building - her would not be able to build it. We commit to follow LATOKEN Principles. If we violate any of them we report it, make our best to fix mistake and learn from the failure. We help teammates to follow the principles. If we think one is violating the principles - we will tell about it to her or speak up to her supervisor, and of course would not talk behind a person's back without her supervisor. 1. Our Goal of Life is to make the world better with a product Otherwise, what would one do in a startup? Why does startup need tension originated by conflicts of other goals with the innovator's mission? How would one choose the right priorities? There will be constant tensions with our principles such as Client First, Ego Last or Never waste time or Get out of comfort. Align your daily tasks with the product mission via grandma clear OKRs. If you do not understand the mission - make extra effort to understand. “Company has no vision or mission or culture”  is a top excuse of agents to freeride principals. If you need to be inspired - do not do this. Get out. 2. Clients First, Ego Last We are the users. Be the client of the product you are building.Test it, and talk with clients. Align each task and second of your life with the clients success. Architect 200 trln of your synapses and 100x more of synapses around for your life mission lasting beyond your body life. Every evening or weekend you have meaningful time with yourself, teammates, your relatives and friends helpful to achieve your mission. Isn't it? Feel grievance about clients , not about yourself. Clients are not for serving our egos of being the rulers of the future.  Do not defend or excuse our ego. Think big. Count in second- and third-order consequences. Learn from books of top tech founders and investors. Take a reasonable risk . Tolerate mistakes and do not tolerate incompetence. Mistakes are ok, if reported and learned. If you suffer - good, it means you are growing. 3. Demo or Die. Focus to deliver , never seek excuses and remove bad apples doing the opposite Get shit done. Hardwork and achievement is not a pleasant comfort travel, thus most people try to avoid it. Do not allow to sneak out, force to get shit done. Discover the root problem or blocker. Ask “why did it happen 4 times to get in-depth insight into what should be fixed. Crystalise blokers in projects update and solve one by one. If there are no such clarity, it is likely that the doers decided to work to prove that they should not do the task or task is undoable. Do not allow fake work, nor vague defined work. Eliminate low standards or excuse seeking before a Bad apple spoils entire harvest. If others see that avoiding ownership and seeking excuse is a beneficial strategy - high performance strategy is not a Nash stable anymore and we are dead zombies. Have your highest-performance responsibility area , limit jumping around. Know who you are and what your personal mission is. Double effort when failed. Learning how to get out of shit is the greatest one. Get shit done. 4. Make transparent and accountable work of yourself and teammates to remove freeriders and resolve blockers for sportsman Transparent Work. Projects, Tasks and Work done of each teammate must be clear to you. Each standup you understand who did what yesterday, plan to do today and what are their blockers. Ensure the tasks have real stories Who need What for Why, comments for hours billed are clear and reasonable,   ask “stupid questions” if anything is unclear. Make teammates accountable. Grill evasive behaviours to push bad apple and freeriders out while making clear to others to avoid copying the toxic evasive strategy. If weekly Demo is not done - ask why a teammate did not push hard to resolve blockers. Smash attempts to avoid the questions asked or to blur details of the blockers. You critical thinking skills are very important to judge if there are excuses or real independent blockers. Elimintate covering. Agents (bad apples and freeriders) are making friends to cover each other by injectig lies, changing topics when asked unpleasant questions and mutually avoiding writing clear stories, project updates and blockers. Crush them. Report mistakes. If you feel pain due to accountability, this means you are growing. Get our of comfort to grow. 4. Candid feedback, no politics Give open feedback asap. Wrong public feedback is way better than polite tacit disagreement and talking behind our backs - that is prohibited politics. We do not hide our opinions and never talk behind. If we suffer from our openness - this means we are growing. If we see something unethical or if we are unhappy, it is our job to speak up. Eliminate talking behind and gossips . We share with others only what we would say if the other person was in the room. If we discuss a misalignment - it should be heard by the person or her supervisors as we want to correct it. Otherwise it is likely to be collusion against a teammate, and potentially against all teammates and clients. We stop and report talking behind. Prefer productive open conflict to find a great solution over tacit compromise over mediocracy. Get any feedback to grow. It does not matter if feedback is accurate or not. The ultimate feedback - startup and you are dead 10,000 to 1 if you do not do 10x, 10x and 10x better. You are dead means your culture will not be remembered and passed to next generations. Why do you live then? No politics. Negative public feedback should not change you attitude to a person under fire, work with her like with any other teammate. 5.  Navy Seals to Every Role Raise the bar with any hire. Newcomers must be better than we are today, so we become greater tomorrow. Hire and raise your successor from day one. That is how you accelerate vesting and value of your stocks. Everyone is responsible for hiring. Managers are promoted based on their ability to attract and develop top talent. Do Sugar Cookie traning. Put a pressure early to learn if the Navy Seal is ready for the real encounter. 6. Be Ethically Radically Transparent, Yet Keep Our Secrets and Know Hows Grandma should understand your OKRs, tasks, and failures at first glance. Report mistakes. Hiding mistake espesially with a lie is a crime. Stories must be “Who needs What for Why”. Give open feedback . We do not hide our opinions and never backtalk. If we suffer from our openness - this means we are growing. If we see something unethical or if we are unhappy, it is our job to speak up. Negative feedback in public meeting is better than no feedback. Especially if one demonstrates negligence to the principles. We ask for help when getting stuck or feel incompetent. Keep confidential data under lock such as client personal data, salaries, bonuses, procedures related to security, our conflicts and hurdles. Report to supervisor and CEO if the Principles or Code of Ethics are violated or not working well, report any fake work, any freeriding or cheating. Speak up to compliance , do not wash our dirty linen in public outside company. Follow NDA contract obligations. Public can not be expert in our internal problems.

    "https://coda.io/@latoken/latoken-talent/wartime-principles-94": "Wartime Principles  ·   The Principles: Olympics of Freedom and Responsibility to Build the Future Wartime Principles In wartime, a company is fending off an imminent existential threat. In wartime, a company is fending off an imminent existential threat. Ben Horowitz : “Definitions and Examples Peacetime in business means those times when a company has a large advantage vs. the competition in its core market, and its market is growing. In times of peace, the company can focus on expanding the market and reinforcing the company's strengths. In wartime, a company is fending off an imminent existential threat. Such a threat can come from a wide range of sources including competition, dramatic macro economic change, market change, supply chain change, and so forth. The great wartime CEO Andy Grove marvellously describes the forces that can take a company from peacetime to wartime in his book Only The Paranoid Survive . A classic peacetime mission is Google's effort to make the Internet faster. Google's position in the search market is so dominant that they determined that anything that makes the Internet faster accrues to their benefit as it enables users to do more searches. As the clear market leader, they focus more on expanding the market than dealing with their search competitors. In contrast, a classic wartime mission was Andy Grove's drive to get out of the memory business in the mid 1980s due to an irrepressible threat from the Japanese semiconductor companies. In this mission, the competitive threat—which could have bankrupted the company—was so great that Intel had to exit its core business, which employed 80% of its staff. In my personal experience, I was a peacetime CEO for about 9 months, then a wartime CEO for the next 7 years. My greatest management discovery through that transition was that peacetime and wartime require radically different management styles. Interestingly, most management books describe peacetime CEO techniques while very few describe wartime. For example, a basic principle in most management books is that you should never embarrass an employee in a public setting. On the other hand, in a room filled with people, Andy Grove once said to an employee who entered the meeting late: “All I have in this world is time, and you are wasting my time.” Why such different approaches to management? In peacetime, leaders must maximize and broaden the current opportunity. As a result, peacetime leaders employ techniques to encourage broad-based creativity and contribution across a diverse set of possible objectives. In wartime, by contrast, the company typically has a single bullet in the chamber and must, at all costs, hit the target. The company's survival in wartime depends upon strict adherence and alignment to the mission. When Steve Jobs returned to Apple, the company was weeks away from bankruptcy—a classic wartime scenario. He needed everyone to move with precision and follow his exact plan; there was no room for individual creativity outside of the core mission. In stark contrast, as Google achieved dominance in the search market, Google's management fostered peacetime innovation by enabling and even requiring every employee to spend 20% of their time on their own new projects. Peacetime and Wartime management techniques can both be highly effective when employed in the right situations, but they are very different.  The Peacetime CEO does not resemble the Wartime CEO. Peacetime CEO/Wartime CEO Peacetime CEO knows that proper protocol leads to winning. Wartime CEO violates protocol in order to win. Peacetime CEO focuses on the big picture and empowers her people to make detailed decisions. Wartime CEO cares about a speck of dust on a gnat's ass if it interferes with the prime directive. Peacetime CEO builds scalable, high volume recruiting machines. Wartime CEO does that, but also builds HR organizations that can execute layoffs. Peacetime CEO spends time defining the culture. Wartime CEO lets the war define the culture. Peacetime CEO always has a contingency plan. Wartime CEO knows that sometimes you gotta roll a hard six. Peacetime CEO knows what to do with a big advantage. Wartime CEO is paranoid. Peacetime CEO strives not to use profanity. Wartime CEO sometimes uses profanity purposefully. Peacetime CEO thinks of the competition as other ships in a big ocean that may never engage. Wartime CEO thinks the competition is sneaking into her house and trying to kidnap her children. Peacetime CEO aims to expand the market. Wartime CEO aims to win the market. Peacetime CEO strives to tolerate deviations from the plan when coupled with effort and creativity.  Wartime CEO is completely intolerant. Peacetime CEO does not raise her voice. Wartime CEO rarely speaks in a normal tone. Peacetime CEO works to minimize conflict. Wartime CEO heightens the contradictions. Peacetime CEO strives for broad based buy in. Wartime CEO neither indulges consensus-building nor tolerates disagreements. Peacetime CEO sets big, hairy audacious goals. Wartime CEO is too busy fighting the enemy to read management books written by consultants who have never managed a fruit stand. Peacetime CEO trains her employees to ensure satisfaction and career development. Wartime CEO trains her employees so they don't get their ass shot off in the battle. Peacetime CEO has rules like “we're going to exit all businesses where we're not number 1 or 2.”  Wartime CEO often has no businesses that are number 1 or 2 and therefore does not have the luxury of following that rule. Can a CEO Be Both? Can a CEO build the skill sets to lead in both peacetime and wartime? One could easily argue that I failed as a peacetime CEO, but succeeded as a wartime one. John Chambers had a great run as peacetime CEO of Cisco, but has struggled as Cisco has moved into war with Juniper, HP, and a range of new competitors. Steve Jobs, who employs a classical wartime management style, removed himself as CEO of Apple in the 1980s during their longest period of peace before coming back to Apple for a spectacular run more than a decade later during their most intense war period. I believe that the answer is yes, but it's hard. Mastering both wartime and peacetime skill sets means understanding the many rules of management and knowing when to follow them and when to violate them. Be aware that management books tend to be written by management consultants who study successful companies during their times of peace. As a result, the resulting books describe the methods of peacetime CEOs. In fact, other than the books written by Andy Grove, I don't know of any management books that teach you how to manage in wartime like Steve Jobs or Andy Grove.” Load content from quizgecko.com?

You may imagine a designer drawing these apps. Meet Alex and Anna Alex is a beacon of zen-like calm, drawing inspiration from Anna's supportive smile. Her presence helps him strike a balance between work and life, enabling him to work smarter, not harder, in a state of productive harmony. Their cheerful teammates often gather around the latte machine, sharing stories about weekend movies, shopping adventures, favorite music, photography, and travel experiences. These casual interactions foster a sense of zen and vitality, fueling their enthusiasm for creating another beautiful feature. Are you on the right and the same page with the team? Your first days' orientation sets your entire career. And now you - meet the real tech builders. Meet Ben. Click here if you have watched the above video Ben is far from being a criminal. He is the mastermind behind calming apps like Coinbase, Ripple, Facebook, Twitter, Stripe, Airbnb, and 811 others. As a startup founder, he has achieved a $1.6 billion exit, and as an investor, he boasts 132+ exits through his venture capital fund, Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), which manages $20+ billion. Andreessen Horowitz is not the most sought-after investor for startups merely because of its financial resources. Startups are drawn to Ben for the culture he fosters. It's this culture that enables startups to tackle difficult problems and deliver calming solutions to their clients. Here's a glimpse into the culture he planted back in 2012: Meet Alex. He's the designer behind the Shutterstock image at the top of this page. Alex is likely a competent freelancer who assists numerous clients with similar, basic needs. He avoids tackling complex problems, preferring to maintain a calm demeanor and focusing on simpler issues that he can address in his zen mode. As a pleasant individual, he's a good model for most people who prefer to see average individuals like themselves for comfort. Alex is not one to challenge the status quo, as he doesn't want to upset anyone. He's great at posing for the camera, but not so great at solving the tough problems required to create a new, valuable, and viable product. Anna is his girlfriend. Her primary goal is to ensure that Alex \"belongs to her,\" investing his time and money into their future children. Therefore, her main job isn't her career. Her job is to bind him with weekend rituals (the very thing feminists strive to overcome). If Alex begins to grow too quickly, he might outgrow her and seek independence. Therefore, she might resist him working in a VC startup aiming for skyrocketing growth. She'd prefer him to be a freelancer under her control, who is just slightly more successful than the husbands of their friends. She seeks to balance his success against the risk of losing him, teaching him about work-life balance. Simultaneously, if Alex starts falling behind one of her friend's husbands, she'll point it out. So, Alex isn't interested in his friends' success and prefers them to be slightly behind him. If his friend starts discussing something meaningful, he'd signal, \"Are you trying to show that you're smarter than us?\" and switch the valuable topic to the safe nonsense of a football show, travel, or music. Their imagined happy teammates can't build a new viable feature in a startup. They're unlikely to break free from the mediocre social gravity produced by their comfort rituals, such as discussing shopping or the weather. Real startup teammates would ask these people to leave the startup. They'd wonder which killer feature he learned from competing apps over the weekend. Is the mock-up added into the backlog priorities? Why hasn't she tested it with a no-code tool to check client interest? They'd share insights on user growth or culture learned from meaningful time with their like-minded friends and relatives or from books by \"super angels.” A great product is built to make clients feel calm about hard problems solved by the product. Startup members want to move out of the calm comfort zone to solve hard problems for clients. That's their life goal - to make the world a better place with a product that shifts the boundaries of what's possible. Their culture is shaped by this goal, not by mediocre social gravity. So, where do you learn about culture? From normal Alexes or from titans like Ben? Start-uppers are either Unemployable down-shifters OR Champions made to change the world.

    "https://coda.io/@latoken/latoken-talent/get-stock-options-140": "Get Stock Options  ·   Orientation Get Stock Options We overpay 10-1000x with stocks to principals. Be stakeholder of the future you are building. “if you are offered a seat on a rocket ship, get on—don't ask what seat.” Eric Schmidt We overpay to great performers with stocks If you are a great fit and we do our job really well, you should earn 10-1000x of your any other next job market option. We allocate 20% of company shares to the team. That is 200% of the industry average for Series B SAAS or Fintech companies accordingly to Carta. Source: Carta Why do we overpay with stocks? As Andreessen puts it: “New companies generally should not exist. As existing companies have pretty happy clients, teams, and resources. Startups should punch through status quo.” This means exceptional results of the team, unseen by well established companies. Why startups can be better? Startups' smaller team size helps to make teammates performance transparent and startups can reward with greater stocks upside. These are two powerful tools to solve the Principal-agent and Free rider problems. “Stock Options is a recommendation straight out of something called “ agency theory ”, that says that you have to align the interests of the people managing the firm with the interests of its shareholders. Otherwise, they will only do things that are in their own interest, and will be inactive, lazy, or plain deceitful... ” Freek Vermeulen @ Harvard Business Review 2009 I would add that team “ will only do things that are in their own interest, and will be inactive, lazy, or plain deceitful..” because top performers or principals would be wiped out by agents. Stocks empower principals and discourage agents. Because principal's utility function value future impact for clients, while agent prefer short term benefit of comfort and lack of responsibility. Ask yourself, is your teammate value comfort and lack of responsibility today or her prefer to grow to benefit clients in the future. Or in monetary terms, is her value monthly pay check or stock options? In other words, does her put clients first, ego last? Agent will hire weaker people as is afraid of competitor for his position and salary. Principal will hire stronger candidate to maximize probability of the company to succeed which increase his stock payoff. Decrease monthly pay-check to wipe out agents and overpay to principals with stocks Still, some agents may both value equity and prefer Free rider strategy where others grow capitalization while her is blurring her underperformance. Ambiguity of innovation undermines startup's performance transparency despite of smaller team size. Startups create new professions which have no performance benchmarks or direct metrics to measure her performance. Is her task really doable? This mean an agent can mislead others with her actual results or find excuses why desirable results are impossible. If such teammate earn the same stock options while making less investment with effort, then why would other teammates pursue a different strategy? Effort now seems as a loosing strategy to Free riding strategy. Effort is not a Nash stable strategy anymore. Furthermore, transparency will decline with acceleration when cooperation to cover each other give additional  advantage. Team will sneak to adequate performance killing startup's advantage over legacy companies to seize market share. Stock value is nothing now. Remaining principals quit. Be the principal and force agents out Agents cover each other when they know details of execution unknown to principals. They leverage asymmetry of information to benefit themselves at expense of principals. That is the definition of an agent. Asymmetry of information is the root cause of the principal-agent problem (part of contract and mechanism design theories - 5 Nobel Awards in economics: Arrow 1972, Muskin 2006, Hart & Holmstrom 2016, Milgrom 2020) If you react on weak performance, misleading statements, excuses - you are likely to be principal.  Other principals are interested to reward you with greater stock bonus if you will increase value of all stocks. Principals are interested to push agents out and redistribute their unvested stocks between remaining or new-coming principals. At the same time founder and investors can not get stocks of pushed out agents as team stock pool is fixed at 20%. So they have no other interest then to maximize stocks value by optimizing team pool between principals. The team of principals have even stronger incentives to push agents out as they get both stocks value growth and get more stocks (of pushed out agents). Principals are the main LATOKEN asset. Principals are your main asset as you are a stakeholder of LATOKEN. Remove asymmetries of information and agents. Do not tolerate lack of effort and adequate performance. Give brutal open feedback. Grow as a Principal!

Trading industry after the bubble means a market full of conflicts, scandals, and pressure needed to give birth to the new era of the internet of value. Thus comfort with pressure is a must. Thus, instead of giving a few light weeks to adopt, we use the first weeks to test: i) if a person can leverage pressure to grow and hit targets and ii)  if they tend to be an adequate performer, free-rider or top performer. If you are a hiring manager instructing a newcomer, you might notice that some newcomers agree and confirm that they understand everything you show. In fact, you may realise that they do not understand what you show to them. Then you probably think: Is it an attempt to look better and to fake mental work? Or do they want to please you instead of asking to be more clear? Both patterns are red flags of upcoming fake work and attempt to make friends by covering their fake work. Unlike Netflix, LATOKEN would not prefer to fire, we would give brutal feedback to see if person changes or tries to defend himself with more fake statements and backtalk. (To prevent such defense we like Netflix fire for both backtalk and failure to report backtalk.) Top performers, unlike adequate performers, point on poor or fake work and challenge teammates to fix it. An adequate performer would cover poor or fake work and expect them to be covered in return. They are the source of the Free Rider problem. Average people would decrease their effort by 44% in a team of 7 compared to a team of 1 in the rope pulling competition as Ringelmann and many other researchers confirmed.

Traders and investors are the global brain predicting the future and optimising resource allocation to maximize cash flows and stock prices growth.

Todays' decisions of politicians, regulators and firms impact economy performance in some years. Some of the newbies start to connect the dots: how todays news impact the value of stocks in their portfolio and wellbeing. They start to see the future now and act as stakeholders to make it better. They are a better educated voters, so politicians have less chance to fool them. 55% of adult US population bought stocks in 2019 only.

LATOKEN has a better outlook as we strive to make the best support service and product Yet, most of scam mentions are to speedup customer support to push KYC forward or restore access to account frozen due to suspicious activity (such as password brut force attacks). After the issue is resolved, a client would unlikely to remove negative tweet or review. Other categories of negative mentions by order of magnitude: High fees for tier 3 tokens where 10-100x price jump resulted in corresponding fees growth before we figure this out and fix. Dormant accounts fees were also negative contributors, so we removed them. Weak IEO results. As the largest primary market for digital assets in the world with 170+ IEOs since 2017 we make it easy for entrepreneurs to connect with investors. Do not take it wrong, we do not sell or make investment advise. That is not an exchange business - we must be neutral. Most of startups would fail to be attractive for investors. Anyway, some entrepreneurs expect to pay 2 BTC and get 20 BTC back. Why? Is it their competence or our sales managers solicitation? How would we control communications with prospects of a hundred sales ambassadors? We made IEO service free of charge in 2019 and such conflicts calmed down. Blackmailing activity (pay me or I will spread negative reviews real or libels) We have close to 1 million accounts and 474 “latoken scam” mentions in google. It does not mean that we have 474 legal cases. Binance does not have 19 900 legal cases. In crypto Scam often have a meaning of an adjective intended to attract attention to negative feelings like “fuck, it does not work well”. In fiat world the word “scam” mentioned against a company often trigger criminal investigation against company or a libel lawsuit against the claimant. In google search results “Binance scam” is mentioned 19 900 times vs 20 million “Binance” or 0.1% . “LATOKEN scam” is mentioned 474 times vs 1 million “LATOKEN” or 0.047% negative mention ratio. Crypto trading industry after the bubble means market full of conflicts, scandals and pressure needed to give a birth to new era of internet of value. Thousands of crypto startups failed. That is normal for VC market and comparable with dot com bubble. It took 15 years to recover investments for average investor into tech companies index. Most of the companies which were in this index back to 2000 are bankrupt, few rule the planet today. Blockchain outperforms internet. Crypto capitalisation recovered 50% of the bubble decline in 2 years comparing to dot com bubble's 12 years for corresponding recovery. However, scale of people involved and lack of regulation facilitated greater number of scums, shareholders and teams' conflicts, and blackmailing. Blackmailing attacks are designed to impair clients or team relations are the norm here to force startups to pay to blackmailer. We do not pay. Would you invest in a person who would likely to flee at any moment due to negative news? We prefer to check her “immunity” to conflicts and ability to leverage pressure and constructive conflicts for growth, creativity and performance. In New Orlean (mid 19th), you would not find job or get a loan or marry without immunity to yellow fever. Companies were loath to train an employee who might succumb to an outbreak. Fathers were hesitant to marry their daughters to husbands who might die. You should get diseased with yellow fever (50% chance to die that time) in order to get the immunity needed to become a real citizen. High load capital markets and bubble scandals enables us to leverage brutal feedback. The main goal of such feedback is to ensure that adequate performers do not cover each other to protect their comfort status quo at expense of clients and top performers. They should either to grow into top performers who challenge each other to grow and perform, instead of covering each others' lack of competence and effort. Otherwise adequate performers should go to legacy companies where such behaviours flourish.

He had spent his earnings from past victories generously, choosing to travel instead of training. In his last fight, he performed well but failed to deliver a critical hit for the win. As a result, he was now so impoverished that local merchants wouldn't even loan him enough money for a steak. The next day, he was to fight against a rising star, Sandel. All he could afford to eat was bread and gravy, and he had to send his wife and children to bed without food. King lost the fight. He was convinced that if he had been able to eat a steak before the fight, the outcome would have been different. Having already taken out credit on the loser's share of the purse, he left the fight penniless and in despair. King wept during his two-mile walk home, unable to afford a cab ride. He knew he would never win again. \"A Piece of Steak\"  by Jack London, 1909 Consider a jaguar that chases an antelope several times but fails to catch it. The jaguar may run out of energy for the next chase. Each subsequent chase with less energy means a lower probability of success and a lower chance of replenishing its energy. The jaguar is in its death valley, where death is imminent. The jaguar will die of hunger. San Francisco is full of homeless entrepreneurs - Jaguars who went into the Death valley. Mobilise effort to make a critical hit to break the wall or all of your work will be in vain, leading to burnout. If multiple random light shots can't break a heavy wall, then you've just wasted energy, and you'll die, taking your teammates down with you. Breaking a wall means delivering a change in business with sustainable value that exceeds the costs used and ideally surpasses alternative costs. You must have a laser-focused vision to hit the weak spot with a single, well-powered shot. You have one or a few shots to take aim. If the shot is too light, we won't be able to determine if the aim was correct. If you break the wall, you get recharged. If you don't hit and if you're a normal person, your brain will command you to conserve energy with each miss. Consequently, you'll be less likely to make a sufficient effort to make a hit with each subsequent shot. This is the Death Valley. That's why we seek exceptional people determined to succeed. They never give up, never quit because they learned to make critical hits back in their childhood. What did they learn in childhood that forged their character to break walls that stop others? They learned to be conscious and responsible for their actions. They learned how to use each miss to correct their aim, double their effort, and ensure the target will be hit, unlike those who prefer to make excuses. Unlike excuse seekers, strong characters can endure failure while doing everything to hit with a single shot at all costs. They focus with clear WHO needs WHAT for WHY stories and prohibit others from blurring tasks with vague, poorly structured definitions. Focus for crit hit, be determined to succeed, never give up, never quit. “The Death Valley” #nakedmanagement \"The Death Valley\" is a self-perpetuating decline in the probability of achieving a product-market fit. This decline is due to a decrease in the effort to make critical hits as the team wastes energy and sees a lack of traction. The self-enforcing process begins with a lack of vision for the end result. A team that doesn't see where it's going, won't get anywhere. A lack of progress means a lower probability of getting a return on effort. Thus, there's less incentive to make the extra effort to start developing a vision for the end result. Creating a vision for the end result requires extra effort: The effort to visualize it: Write a WHO/WHAT/WHY Story, Vision novel, Problems/Solutions, To Do, draw a mind map (avoid seduction to write just few bullet points, always write Stories at least to build a habit) The painful responsibility of acknowledging the result (Recognizing that sometimes what you do is useless, regardless of the effort put in). If I don't see where I'm going, then I'm not responsible. I'm just doing something someone told me to do or what I feel like doing at the moment, regardless of whether it's needed for the clients or not. Instinctively, I want recognition, higher titles, a better salary, and more influence, while wanting less responsibility and effort. So, I aim for a higher risk-adjusted ROI on my effort. If I don't measure the result for clients and don't take responsibility for that, then the value for clients is not in my ROI formula. Naturally, I expend energy only on variables in my ROI formula: recognition, titles, salary, influence. There are no client metrics here. And I feel demotivated if I don't get recognition, etc., for consulting teammates and jumping around, I feel the tensions of normal and median people. This is the lack of commitment and accountability well described in “ Five dysfunctions of teams “. Connect your brain's ROI formula with the client metrics, or abandon the ambition to build a product and remain a median person.

Fire B or A quit. Based on  “No Rules Rule of Netflix” shortlisted by Financial Times & McKinsey as a business book of 2020 Star blast pressure To avoid bankruptcy in 2001 Reed Hastings tried to sell Netflix to the old video rental market leader - Blockbuster. He got rejection. He was desperate: how would Netflix compete with the old giants if there is no investors around for his experiments after dot com bubble. Generally, new companies should not exist. Why not Blockbuster build a new product and up-sell it to its user base at negligible client acquisition costs? The step to Dense Talent He had to fire 1/3 of their team. They fired nice guys with adequate performance, pessimistic super performers, less motivated, over motivated hard-workers with poor judgement. “Morale in the office was low, and it was about to get lower. We had to lay off a third of our workforce,” Hastings says. “We didn't have any obviously poor performers. So we divided the staff into two piles: the 80 highest performers who we would keep, and 40 less amazing ones” Fired people were pissed off and slammed doors. Reed expected a backslash from remaining people angry for firing their friends and insecure about their future. Suddenly, performance soared. He and his teammates started to love to come to work Netflix realised that “For top performers, a great workplace isn't about a lavish office, a beautiful gym, or free sushi. It's about people who can help you be better. When every member is excellent, performance spirals upward as employees learn from and motivate one another.” (link) Netflix made their first step to build the culture which made 200+m clients happy, $250+ billion value and Blockbuster bankrupt. Adequate performers and free riders kill Blockbuster passed away like many others due to the same reason: Normal performers and free riders. Normal teams tolerate those who perform on par with team average or below. And it kills them. One weak teammate diminish team performance by 30-40% found professor Will Felps . He compared performance for teams of college students — where a “bad apple teammate” actor was added to behave like a slacker, a jerk, or a pessimist. Normal performance is infectious and magnify the Report Free Riding which kills organisations. Adequate performers prefer to cover each other rather than to challenge each other to overachieve. To control and maintain performance of medium people and free riders, organizations build complex rules and bureaucracy at expense of creativity and agility. Vicious circle. Fire average people and foster candor to enable creativity Netflix's managed to get out of this vicious circle. Their massive lay off of the average and below staff created the talent density. Reed found that talent density coupled with candid feedback solve the adequate performers and free rider problems. So less bureaucracy needed to control these two categories. Now company can afford Freedom for creativity guided by responsibility for mission and goals. It was a scandal “do you treat average people like garbage you want to trash out to other companies”? Other would argue, why would you put such harsh wording. Normal people should work in the companies of the past. That is normal and deserve respect. Fire with respect. There were some scandals naming Steve Jobs as a jerk. He was cruel to embarrass employees and fired publicly for doubting that a task is doable. There were younger wartime companies cultures (outlined by Ben Horowitz 5 years later), and Zappos with their sweet family HR PR campaign. Reed's slides became shocking documentation of a real tech culture unexpected from a relatively large creative company. Psychological safety is for the past Harvard professors prayed for psychological safety as a must for creativity. The academic consensus was: Netflix culture can not exist in large organisations (the reason why tech companies and definitely startups avoid hiring MBAs). Since then Netflix capitalisation grown 100x, Nasdaq 9x (tech), Dow Jones (traditional industries) 2.5x. 10 years after that scandal, Gary Pisano admitted at Harvard Business Review : “Innovative cultures are generally depicted as pretty fun. When I asked the same managers to describe such cultures, they readily provided a list of characteristics identical to those extolled by management books: tolerance for failure, willingness to experiment, psychological safety, highly collaborative, and nonhierarchical. The easy-to-like behaviours that get so much attention are only one side of the coin. They must be counterbalanced by some tougher and frankly less fun behaviors. A tolerance for failure requires an intolerance for incompetence. A willingness to experiment requires rigorous discipline. Psychological safety requires comfort with brutal candor. Collaboration must be balanced with individual accountability. And flatness requires strong leadership. Innovative cultures are paradoxical. Unless the tensions created by this paradox are carefully managed, attempts to create an innovative culture will fail.” In 2009 the new cultural era was born. The goal of life “happiness” turned into goal of life “meaningfulness”. Which mean you must go out of comfort to grow and shift frontiers to create value. Otherwise you can not work in fast evolving tech companies. The companies which rule the planet today or tomorrow. These scandals and cultural change nurtured a scalable labour force able to build SpaceX. Freedom and Responsibility Freedom sucks without Talent density and Candor In 1994 Reed Hastings found his sales manager billing his previous company with $3000+ ($700 in 1990x) for one hotel night. Instead of demonstrative firing he introduced rules to approve travel and accommodation. He made many other rules such as you need an approval if you come to office with a pet. Today Netflix does not have any travel and vacation policy. No Rules Rule. Reed warns: “Once you have build talent density, you can safely address candor. Only then can you safely began remove policies that control your staff.” If you do not have talent density - addressing candor is risky. If you do not have Talent Density and Candor - Freedom will fail. Adequate performers with free riders will lower the bar and force top performers to quit. Adequate performers would help each other to protect their comfort and call jerks those who raise the bar. A players attract A players to grow. B attract C players to feel comfort as look adequate comparing to C. Fire B players or B will push A out in order to defend their comfort. Keep only top performers and establish candor to enable freedom and creativity. Build the Culture of Freedom and Responsibility: Step 1. Build Talent Density: Great work place is Stunning Colleagues. Top performers should hire top performers challenging each other to overachieve and fire adequate performers who prefer to cover each others mediocracy. When achieved - build candor. Step 2. Build Candor: Say what you really think, especially negative feedback, - with positive intent. No backtalk. Fire for backtalk or for failure to report backtalk. Only if you have 1+2 move to: Step 3. Reduce Controls and Bureaucracies: Growth of top performers should exceed growth of complexity. Top performers should be disciplined and have freedom to be creatively focused on clear goals and strategy. Do you plan to be a top performer or an adequate performer? It is easy to check.

    "https://coda.io/@latoken/latoken-talent/report-free-riding-110": "Report Free Riding  ·   #nakedmanagement Report Free Riding If one can benefit from fake work - all others will end up poorly. Report free riding immediately to make such strategy punished. These guys above seem to do their best. Mr. Ringelmann would doubt it. He would estimate their performance is at least 44% below their potential as there are at least 7 participants on the picture. I would add that they are likely to exaggerate expression of effort comparing to their facial expression when they pull the rope alone. Welcome to the Free Rider problem a part the Principal-Agent Problem or Agency Theory (btw it is big contributor Paul Milgrom won Nobel Prize 2020). Ringelmann (1913) found that having group members work together on a task (e.g., pulling a rope) actually results in significantly less effort than when individual members are acting alone. Ringelmann discovered that as more and more people are added to a group, the group often becomes increasingly inefficient, ultimately violating the notion that group effort and team participation reliably leads to increased effort on behalf of the members. Subsequent research has aided the further development of the Ringelmann effect theory. Most notably, Ingham, Levinger, Graves, and Peckham (1974) discovered that group members continue to exhibit reductions in rope-pulling force even after being placed in pseudo-groups (i.e., groups composed of confederates and one, true participant). In their study, Ingham et al. (1974) directed confederates to pretend to pull on a rope by faking exertion, suggesting to the real participant that all members were working together. What proves of interest here is that because there was virtually no coordination between the participant and the confederates (they were not physically taking part in the actions), poor communication cannot account for the decrease in effort.[11] Therefore, Ingham et al. (1974) support the assertion that motivational losses largely determine an individual's decline in performance when acting as a member of a group. In addition, research has shown that participants who have previous experience in a team sport may not show the Ringelmann effect. The reason why teammates put less effort is because they can free ride each other if nobody can measure their effort (here is an asymmetry of information) and punish for cheating. Hard workers are in disadvantage as they would lose the most energy, while the prize would be spliced equally independently of effort. Thus hardwork is not a beneficial and desirable strategy (eg. it is not Nash stable as someone can pursue a different strategy with a larger benifit). Furthermore free riders tend to cooperate to cover each other and protect their status quo by lowering the bar for transparency and performance. The star-blast pressure of market competition force teams to give a birth to cultures which penalise free riding. In fact companies compete by how they are successful to solve the free rider problem. Culture is how this problem is solved. The most powerful invention here is the transparency and accountability for the result well encoded in our The Principles: Olympics of Freedom and Responsibility to Build the Future . If you see someone tweak her OKRs to look better - make it transparent If you see someone pretend to work - make it transparent If you see someone cover her mistakes or negligence - make it transparent If you see someone seek excuses - make it transparent Make free riding transparent by speaking up or asking questions at morning sync or unit/ceomessage slack. Get this shit out of our culture and embrace those who do not tolerate free riders. Remember: New companies generally should not exist New companies could exist only because they invent a better culture a better solution to the free rider problem  to punch through status quo.

    "https://coda.io/@latoken/latoken-talent/run-through-the-death-valley-122": "Run Through The Death Valley  ·   #nakedmanagement Run Through The Death Valley Each calorie in a startup body is to test hypothesys toward product-market fit. Do not waste it on freeriders. My interest in startups was sparked when I discovered that Stanford alumnus Maxim Faldin had launched Wikimart, Russia's equivalent to Amazon. In 2010, I was captivated by his blog, where he envisioned how tech entrepreneurs could shape the future. However, a decade later, I learned that Maxim had declared personal bankruptcy , with a debt of approximately $3 million, while Wikimart had lost around $83 million in investments. It's important to note that only about one in 10,000 startups make it to an IPO. Statistically, it's far more likely that you'll hear about my bankruptcy than news of my team and I building a unicorn. However, we believe we are outliers due to our culture of hitting sequential targets towards a significant mission. This is why you're reading this piece on our wartime culture deck, one of the most detailed in the world. Don't misunderstand me. Changing the world is a challenging endeavor, and some people are born to attempt it. They understand that Comfort is Suicide . . Maxim, despite his setbacks, changed the world by paving the way for people like you and me with his efforts. He could still leverage his experience to make a significant impact next time. So, where are the other startups that don't make it to IPO? They're in the \"Death Valley.\" The \"Death Valley\" is a self-reinforcing decline in the probability of achieving product-market-timing fit. This decline is due to a decrease in effort to make critical hits as the team wastes energy and sees a lack of traction. If a jaguar chases an antelope several times and fails to catch it, she may run out of energy for the next chase. Each subsequent chase with less energy means a lower probability of success to recharge energy. At some point, the jaguar enters her death valley, where death is imminent. The jaguar will die from hunger. San Francisco is full of homeless entrepreneurs - jaguars who ventured into the Death Valley. This self-reinforcing process begins with a lack of vision of the result, leading to inaccurate performance evaluation, declining performance standards, and the emergence of free riders. Free riders will reinforce the blurring of the vision and results to benefit from the principal-agent problem (agents increase the asymmetry of information to cheat principals). If a coalition of agents is stronger than principals, a turnaround is impossible. Agents avoid performance transparency. Vision of the result means extra costs which agents prefer to avoid: The effort to make the result clear (would you write a Who/What Why Story if you can do less effort by writing a few bullets?) The painful responsibility for the result (recognizing that what you do is useless). Agents feel resistance to do extra effort for clarity as it means responsibility. If I do not see where to go, then I am not responsible. I am just doing something somebody said and also doing what I want to do at the moment, whether it is needed for clients or not. What do agents want? Higher salary and titles, recognition, and influence to protect the above for less responsibility and effort. Agents optimize the Return On Investment of their effort to maximize output as measured by their above utility function unlinked from clients and company. Principals have different variables in their utility function: Principals grow the number of successful clients and stock options value. And they invest full responsibility and effort to achieve such goals of life. They put clients first, ego last. The agent will feel demotivated if they receive candid feedback about the lack of transparency of their impact on clients' success. Transparency and impact on clients are not in their utility function. They need recognition and promotion. Their effort is about team destructive self-educating, covering other teammates, and lowering standards to consolidate the political support base of other agents. The line is crossed if the fake effort is rewarded. The line to the valley was already crossed when one of the sportsmen who faked his effort to row in one season is with the team in the next season. This is likely to mean that teammates did not report a free rider as they decided to cheat and cover each other in the next season. Thus, the coach will be less likely to detect and punish this pattern. Cheating will become a Nash stable strategy as it gives an immediate advantage over a full effort strategy. Professional sportsmen do not fake effort in the Ringelmann rope polling experiment, because the coach knows each game if they are losing and get rid of free riders fast. If the team and coach have a blurred vision of the result and cannot measure performance - all of their work is likely to be cheating from the very beginning. Even if they believed that they were hardworking, they were hard working to learn politics. Is Maxim desperate here to get rid of agents collected on scaling before building the principals' culture?

I still treasure the memories of our village kids gang mates. One early morning, we tossed stones at Serge's window to wake him up for a fishing trip. Serge, who lived in the block next to mine, was six years my senior. I can still picture his face and hands, the ones that taught me how to hook a fish. We both ended up falling into the water, but we were proud to show off our trophy fish to the gang and my grandmother. Serge cared for me like an older brother, even though we weren't related. After that, I never saw him again. 22 years later, Serge shoot himself in the head with his grandfather's gun, staring out of the same window we used to throw stones at to wake him up for fishing. What could he have possibly seen in that window that drove him to such despair at the age of 35? Serge was a brilliant individual, having graduated with summa cum laude honors from a top math faculty at MSU. He moved to the U.S. to teach maths at Boston University. At 25, he returned home for a holiday and stayed at his countryside home, or 'dacha'. He was supposed to fly back to the U.S. in a few weeks, but he never boarded that flight. Instead, he chose to stay with his girlfriend, enjoying the comfort of his dacha and the peaceful songs of century-old pine trees. I believe that after seven years, Serge began to yearn for his career. He was a born champion, destined to change the world, but he realized he had lost his chance to do so. He didn't lose it in a competition, but in the comfort of his dacha. His champion spirit, encoded in trillions of brain connections, couldn't find an answer to the question, \"Did you do your best to change the world?\" I've seen this scenario play out many times. Some people didn't have a gun, so they turned to vodka and drugs. You reach 35, look back at your life, and see the wrong answers to the question. Who you are is defined by what you do to answer Ben's question. Ben saw Alex in the window.\n\nOver that summer holiday, Serge's Ben retreated to Alex. But Ben can't die. Ben has survived and evolved over billions of years to create humankind. Each generation, Ben gives birth to a better Ben under the star blast pressure of market competition. If the next Ben is born, all Alexes make way for a better life. All past Bens are Alexes destined to fade with a window glimpse. The program for the next Ben's birth is in everyone, as we are all past Bens. However, it only self-activates in a fraction of the population. This program is the question, \"Did you do your best to try to change the world?\" Once activated, it can't be forgotten.\n\nIf you're reading this, it means the question was asked. The program to spearhead evolution was activated. We are the Ben giving birth to the next Ben. You can't suppress your nature, and there's no reason to. You can't kill your Ben and live as an Alex.

My answer was something “We tested LA airdrop and get hundreds of thousands registrations.”Later I was thinking, why I violated the rule to answer what was asked? Such mistake costed me position to lead utilities equity research of EMEA region at Goldman Sachs 13 years ago in London. I become just a 2nd candidate to this role after final interview. I realised that I felt 2 shocks when heard Dmitry: A developer was interested to look outside of the code to learn about use case and clients. Just a day before I was asked publicly “why a developer should be distracted from coding with Sprint meetup?” The Dmitry's question was a shocking contrast to some the shitty patterns of our current culture: “I am not in charge of clients and results, so it is someone fails, not me. I solve hard problems to grow skills and cv value to resell it in a year.” “I do not use product I build. I do not want to see these failures.” “Making my results and responsibility transparent with OKRs is a waste of time. We should sabotage with poorly defined metrics”. “I am not in charge of hiring and growing teammates. I want lower the bar to feel comfort and have no successors who can replace me.

I prefer to feel smart myself, bargain and protect status quo.” “I will prove that a task is undoable, and will help others to prove that their tasks are not doable, so we can help each other to protect comfort zone. That is how I find friends quickly.”  Take a shitty example from today's breakfast: “I done my research: We cant get a response from top tokens for co-marketing” 2.

Libra, TON, digital yuan and dollar made a billion people craving a stable currency unpegged from central banks. We can make it happen: available everywhere, and stable with a decentralised monetary policy targeting inflation. LIBERTA countdown c.60 Days. Objective: Liberta people with stable unpegged currency at fingertips for every corner of internet. Key Result: 1 m daily active users, spreading the greatest currency and products to fingertips. Future value of the currency could be used to pay early adopters to make this future happen. Impediments to overcome: FIAT DEPOSIT attempt should grow to 50% from 1%. So we hook L airdroppers  with actual daily use case. We have 800 attempts per day with 8 successes. @arkon @dk VIRALITY of B2B airdrops should hit >1. And Liberta page with Davos board well prepared @Alexander Kotin LACHAIN. Liberta should be transferrable in LACHAIN so people have trust to spur virality, we get nodes and blockchain users. @Dmitry Ivashchenko SCALABILITY. We should test and prepare product for 10 000 realtime active users with 10k orders sent to order book in a second. @ds CULTURE of accountability for result. Get rid of blurred mediocracy polishing her cv and comfort, embrace those who dare to have a vision and responsibility for that.

Ben makes Critical hits while getting done shit produced by Alex . Ben raises the bar and attracts into team those who is stronger than himself to expand the glimpse of the future. Alex raises shit - fake work, and friends helping to raise awareness that tasks are undoable and thus Alexes are not accountable. Alex attracts even weaker Alexes to spread their shit together and protect their comfort zone instead of making extra efforts. Alex wants team to get weaker to bargain his comfort and avoid being replaced by a Ben. While Alex waits Ben to create value to free ride some of it. Alex tries to prove that Ben does not have the glimpse of the future, no future, no vision of it. Alex want to preserve his comfort past and blur the glimpse of the future. Alex wants to avoid being replaced by a Ben. He does not want future to replace past. Ben - you know from the president and billionaires that our market is the next internet of value, built on top of internet of information. Ben - you know that we learned how to spread the technology and our app. This means we are not crazy to dream to change planet while been Alexes.

His mediocre performance was not a big problem itself. The problem was the conflict of interests. Some colleagues felt friction with the team goals and pointed to our principles.

    "https://coda.io/@latoken/latoken-talent/the-code-of-ethics-17": "The Code of Ethics  The Code of Ethics The Shocking Rules High load pressure of Trading after the bubble LATOKEN Code of Business Conduct and Ethics The LATOKEN Code of Ethics and the Principles embody the firm's commitment to benefit the society by adopting the decentralised technology to make investments, trading, payments and money management as a whole available worldwide at a fraction of costs. Access to investments makes people global stakeholders learning how the world works and empowers them to influence the future. Access to money makes people freer to choose how to grow by buying products and services. Our mission is to put financial life at fingertips. So people can use money to bring ideas into life and become stakeholders of a better future. Why do we need the Code The Code sets the basic and powerful rules such as prevention of conflicts of interests. The Code is the fundament for more sophisticated principles and the culture needed for exceptional performance to achieve the core mission. The Code empowers the team to make the right choices and to overcome hurdles and “impossible” things and ensures they are done with joy and courage. This firm's commitment implies a combination of vision coupled with hard work and ethics leading to extreme performance needed to make a structural change in the way people fundraise, invest and manage money. The capital market manages the planetary resources and mankind's future. The structural changes here mean intensive conflicts between those who benefit from the change and those who lose. It is the matter of our viability to build the team which is capable of overcoming such conflicts, to structure the support base, and to minimize costs for those who lose (Uber transformed taxi business and had scandals and scrutiny across the world..). Furthermore, we shall be prepared for hurdles coming from the regional political risks, devastated local capital market expertise and the short-sighted rent-seeking cultural patterns dominating the local labour market. Additional layers of cultural complexity come from the infant stage of the decentralised industry lacking regulations and practices needed to evolve to meet modern ethical standards and regulation. We acknowledge that some of the industry business practices can not be avoided by the industry players as such avoidance significantly impairs their market position. In this way, collective behavioural change is required and could be achieved with the help of regulation. We are committed to develop the industry rules and practices and call for regulation where necessary. We are committed to meet the highest ethical standards and be in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. The Code applies to all of our teammates. Reporting Issues under the Code It is critical that you strive to identify and escalate potential issues before they lead to problems. When in doubt, you should ask questions about the potential application of this Code to your supervisor or senior management and the CEO. Should you become aware of any existing or potential violation of this Code, promptly notify senior management or the CEO of the firm. Violations of the Code We take this Code and your obligations under it very seriously and will take any disciplinary or preventive action deemed appropriate to address existing or potential violations of the Code, up to and including termination of contract, stock bonuses/options or legal actions. Violations of the Code may also constitute violations of law, which may result in criminal or civil penalties for you and the firm. Put interests of the firm and its clients ahead of personal interests Put interests of the firm and clients ahead of personal goals - that is a fundamental cooperation basis to build trust, stellar performance and great product, and, as a result, sustainable growth of your character and career. We do not tolerate short-sighted sighted strategies designed to look better or avoid responsibility or to protect the comfortable status quo at the expense of the company performance and clients. You must detect and prevent  behavioral patterns such as: faking work and results, hiding mistakes or weaknesses to look better, defending yourself to avoid responsibility and effort, sabotaging those who come to fix something which you failed to do, involving others into negative back talk against peers, supervisor or the firm. Your leadership role is to inspire teammates and to align them with our common goal, with our mission. You do it by showing your commitment, hardworking and goal-oriented spirit. You set the bar and raise it constantly for yourself and teammates. The dedication of our teammates to the firm and clients, the intense effort they do is greater than one finds in most other organizations. Prevent talking behind one's back, impose constructive problem solving You must immediately stop negative back talking when you witness such behavior and request to invite the named colleague to participate in the discussion. An exemption is the discussion involving a supervisor of the person. Discussions of colleagues' mistakes and their personalities in their absence allows a person  to take an unfair advantage over such colleagues and get short term benefits while causing extensive damage to the morale and career of teammates and performance of the firm. The same applies to any propagation of negative information or talk against the company in the absence of the CEO. Personal Conflicts of Interest A personal conflict of interest occurs when your private interest improperly interferes with the interests of the firm. Actions or relationships that create personal conflicts of interest are prohibited, unless approved by the firm in written form. It is important that you carefully consider whether any of your activities or relationships, including volunteer positions outside the firm, could cause a conflict (or the appearance of a conflict) with the interests of the firm. Even if an activity seems unrelated to your role at the firm, you may be required to obtain pre-approval before engaging in it. Additionally, personal gain and advantage must never take precedence over your obligations to the firm. You must never use or attempt to use your position at the firm to obtain any improper personal benefit for yourself, family member(s) or any other individual or group. If you are aware of a transaction or relationship that could give rise to a conflict of interest or perceived conflict of interest, you should discuss the matter promptly with the CEO. When in doubt, raise the question for appropriate consideration. Business Opportunities You are prohibited from taking for yourself (or directing to any other person) a business opportunity that is discovered through the use of corporate property, information or position at the firm, unless the firm explicitly in written form approves such use of the opportunity. More generally, you are prohibited from using corporate property, information or position for personal gain or competing with the firm. The prudent course of action is to obtain pre-approval from the CEO for any use of firm property or services that is not solely for the benefit of the firm. Non Solicitation Any solicitation to work outside of the firm mission must be prevented and reported. Such solicitations include discussions of job market opportunities, personal startup ideas, introductions to head hunters or any person for a hiring reason. Compliance with Laws, Rules and Regulations You must comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including those related to insider trading, financial reporting, money laundering, fraud, bribery and corruption. Generally, if you are aware of material nonpublic information relating to the firm, any of our clients or any other private or governmental issuer of securities, you cannot buy or sell any securities of those issuers or recommend that another person buy, sell or hold the securities of those issuers. Questions regarding the purchase or sale of any firm securities or any securities of issuers that you are familiar with by virtue of your role at LATOKEN should be directed to an appropriate ethics contact prior to any purchase or sale. Protecting Confidential Information In the course of business, our people often have access to confidential or proprietary information about the firm, our clients, prospective clients or other third parties. Our business and reputation depend on the commitment of each of you to protect this information. You must maintain the confidentiality of the information with which you are entrusted, including complying with information barrier procedures applicable to your business. The only exception is when disclosure is authorized or legally mandated. Confidential or proprietary information includes, among other things, any non-public information concerning the firm (including its businesses, financial performance, results or prospects) and any non-public information provided by a third party with the expectation that the information will be kept confidential and used solely for the business purpose for which it was conveyed. Equal Employment Opportunities and Commitment to Diversity Concern for the personal dignity of each individual is an indispensable element of the standards we set for ourselves at LATOKEN. We focus our personnel decisions on merit and contribution to the firm's success. The firm affords equal employment opportunities to all qualified persons without regard to any impermissible criteria or circumstances. We do not tolerate any type of discrimination prohibited by law, including harassment. We value diversity as an important asset that enhances our culture, helps us serve clients well and maximizes return for shareholders. For us to excel, we must create for our people an inclusive environment that welcomes and supports differences and encourages input from all perspectives. Protecting and Properly Using Firm Assets You should protect the firm's assets and ensure their efficient use. All firm assets should be used for legitimate business purposes only. Business Principles We stress creativity and imagination in everything we do. While recognizing that the old way may still be the best way, we constantly strive to find a better solution to the client's problems. We pride ourselves on pioneered many of the practices and techniques that will become standard in the industry. We make an unusual effort to identify and recruit the very best person for every job.  In a service business, we know that without the best people, we cannot be the best firm. We offer our people the opportunity to move ahead more rapidly than is possible at most other places. Advancement depends on merit and we have yet to find the limits to the responsibility our best people are able to assume. For us to be successful, our men and women must reflect the diversity of the communities and cultures in which we operate. That means we must attract, retain and motivate people from many backgrounds and perspectives. Being diverse is not optional; it is what we must be. We stress teamwork in everything we do. While individual creativity is always encouraged, we have found that team effort often produces the best results. We have no room for those who put their personal interests ahead of the interests of the firm and its clients . The dedication of our people to the firm and the intense effort they give to their jobs are greater than one finds in most other organizations. We think that this is an important part of our success. We consider our size an asset that we try hard to preserve. We want to be big enough to undertake the largest project that any of our clients could contemplate, yet small enough to maintain the loyalty, the intimacy and the esprit de corps that we all treasure and that contribute greatly to our success. We constantly strive to anticipate the rapidly changing needs of our clients and to develop new services to meet those needs. We know that the world of finance will not stand still and that complacency can lead to extinction. Additional Procedures All of our employees are required to affirm that they have reviewed the Code and will comply with it.   Our clients' interests always come first. If we serve our clients well, our own success will follow. Our assets are our people, capital and reputation. If any of these is ever diminished, the last is the most difficult to restore. Despite the infant industry development stage, regulation and common business practices, we are dedicated and we will do all we can to comply with the letter and spirit of the laws, rules and ethical principles that govern us. Significant employee stock ownership aligns the interests of our employees and our shareholders. We take great pride in the professional quality of our work. We have an uncompromising determination to achieve excellence in everything we undertake. Though we may be involved in a wide variety and heavy volume of activity, we would, if it came to a choice, rather be best than biggest. Want to print your doc? This is not the way.

After the issue is resolved, a client would unlikely to remove negative tweet or review. Other categories of negative mentions by order of magnitude: High fees for tier 3 tokens where 10-100x price jump resulted in corresponding fees growth before we figure this out and fix. Dormant accounts fees were also negative contributors, so we removed them. Weak IEO results. As the largest primary market for digital assets in the world with 170+ IEOs since 2017 we make it easy for entrepreneurs to connect with investors.

Anyway, some entrepreneurs expect to pay 2 BTC and get 20 BTC back. Why? Is it their competence or our sales managers solicitation?

We prefer to check her “immunity” to conflicts and ability to leverage pressure and constructive conflicts for growth, creativity and performance. In New Orlean (mid 19th), you would not find job or get a loan or marry without immunity to yellow fever. Companies were loath to train an employee who might succumb to an outbreak. Fathers were hesitant to marry their daughters to husbands who might die. You should get diseased with yellow fever (50% chance to die that time) in order to get the immunity needed to become a real citizen. High load capital markets and bubble scandals enables us to leverage brutal feedback. The main goal of such feedback is to ensure that adequate performers do not cover each other to protect their comfort status quo at expense of clients and top performers. They should either to grow into top performers who challenge each other to grow and perform, instead of covering each others' lack of competence and effort. Otherwise adequate performers should go to legacy companies where such behaviour flourish. If one violates our The Principles: Olympics of Freedom and Responsibility to Build the Future we give an immediate public feedback. If person leverage the feedback to change - he could become a great teammate. If her is trying to defend herself with growing fake statements and backtalk (to prevent backtalk defence strategy we, like Netflix, fire for both backtalk and failure to report backtalk) - we want to see it on her first week. Thus comfort with pressure is a must. And we leverage it for First week: star-blast pressure to filter out mediocracy"
